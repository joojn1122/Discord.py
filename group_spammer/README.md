# Simple Discord Group Spammer

## It's really slow, but you can troll friends with this, it creates a group with users (specified in "users.json") and leaves it

> users.json
id -> ID of discord user
kick -> after creating a group if user should be kicked (pretty useless, but it can be used if you would like to create a group with only one user (you can't create a group with one user, so you can create group with 2 users and kick one out)) 

after like 10 requests you'll get rate limited, so be aware of that
